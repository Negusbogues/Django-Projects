        <header> Overview</header>
     <p>During Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Jacqueline personally experienced 
        the trauma of the storm and witnessed people who felt helpless 
        and destitute. Determined to make a difference, Bogues decided 
        to become a FEMA Inspector. 
        As a certified FEMA Disaster Housing Inspector, Bogues has played 
        an active and essential role in relief efforts during the following 
        events: New York Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief (2012), Baton 
        Rouge, Louisiana Floods (2016), Hurricanes Irma, Hurricane Maria 
        (both 2017), Hurricane Florence, and Hurricane Michael, (both 2018).
        Bogues continues to respond to FEMAâ€™S request when called.
        Bogues earned her 620 Independent All-Lines Adjuster Certification 
        at Broward College in 2010, which allows her to work as a 1099 
        contractor within the insurance industry.
        In 2011, Jaqueline became one of two hundred (200) certified 
        HUD Inspectors in the United States; Bogues has traveled across 
        the country performing Public/Multifamily Housing, FHA mortgage 
        loans, and NYCHA inspections.
        Since 2018, Bogues has completed HQS rental properties inspections 
        in various cities, ensuring health and safety as a priority for the 
        tenants in the rental community.
